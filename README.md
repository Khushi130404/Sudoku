# Sudoku

Sudoku is an interactive puzzle game built in Android Studio using Java. This app leverages backtracking to solve Sudoku puzzles and provides a seamless user experience through the use of Android fragments. The Sudoku grid is managed using an efficient 4D array structure to represent the entire 9x9 grid as 3x3 sub-grids.
